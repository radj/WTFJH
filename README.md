# What The Fuck Just Happened
> A Modern Replacement For IntroSpy [iSECPartners/Introspy-iOS][1]

> Feel Free To Send Us Pull Requests. 

> It's a project too big for two part-time developers

> Infrastructural Codes Are Copied (And Modified) From IntroSpy Project And My Own MinusBlock Project [Naville/MinusBlock][2] To Save Time.

> *VERSION* is meant to be there for package version consistency's sake

> Also make VERSION changes easy-trackable by reviewing history of **VERSION**

# Usage
>Standard User: *./build.py*

>HackingGuide.md Contains Detailed Explanation
